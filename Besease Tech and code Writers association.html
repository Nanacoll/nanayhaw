alright this is Dr. Eng. Collins.
I'm persuing a biomedical engineering aT <i>ALL NATION UNIVERSITY</i>
I'm an IT expert as well as <b>web and android app development</b>
I know because of my program someone may ask: But you are not an IT Student so how?.what i can say is that to be in passion for something 
is to be all out, meaning my passion for IT is very great and Im in very great pssion for the young and talented student who feel proud to code and program in IT field

<i>Why Programming is Important, Today, and for the Future?</i>
In the digital age that we are in now, the ability to communicate with computers is essential as our lives depend on them.<br/> Many new jobs will depend on programming, and existing jobs that will require coding skills will grow exponentially because most services and products are being digitised.<br/> It means they will work in a virtual environment, and without coding skills, it would be hard to make them work successfully, so how important will it be in the future?
<br/>
All programs and applications are written using many different programming languages; however, learning one of them will be enough to understand the basics of computer programming and how we communicate with them.<br/> We are always progressing and creating new technologies, nearly all of them including computers and communication between them and us.<br/> This means that since programming and having basic knowledge of programs is important today, it will be much more critical in the future as our lives and society are becoming more and more dependent on them (in a good way).
<br/>
Computer programming is vital today because so much of our world is automated. People need to be able to control the interaction between humans and machines.<br/> Since computers and devices can do things so efficiently and accurately, we use computer programming to harness that computing power.
<br/>
Computer programming principles implemented today will likely influence how technologies such as artificial intelligence, voice recognition and other new technologies will change in the future and how they will be applied to our day-to-day lives.<br/> So the ability to understand what is going on in a program or a piece of code and the ability to code is very important and will become more and more critical as we find new ways to use this great way to improve our lives.
<br/>
Programming in the Present
One of the primary reasons programming is important today is the automation and control it enables in the interaction between humans and machines.<br/> Computers and devices possess incredible computational power, and programming allows us to harness that power for our benefit. By writing code, we can automate tasks, streamline processes, and create efficient solutions to complex problems.
<br/>
Programming for the Future
The impact of programming extends beyond the present. The principles and practices implemented today will influence the development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and voice recognition. As these technologies continue to evolve, programming will be at the core of their advancement and application in our day-to-day lives. From smart homes to advanced healthcare systems, programming will shape the future we live in.
<br/>
The Significance of Understanding Code
Having the ability to understand and interpret code is crucial in a world increasingly driven by technology. It empowers individuals to gain insights into the inner workings of programs and applications.<br/> Understanding code enhances problem-solving skills, enabling individuals to identify and fix issues, as well as develop new features and functionalities.<br/> Moreover, it promotes logical thinking and a deeper understanding of computational processes.
<br/>
Coding as a Skill for the Future Workforce
The demand for coding skills is growing rapidly across various industries. As more services and products become digitized, job roles that require programming skills are experiencing exponential growth. <br/>By acquiring programming knowledge, individuals can unlock a wide range of job opportunities and ensure career growth in the digital economy.<br/> Whether itâ€™s software development, data analysis, or cybersecurity, programming skills will be highly sought after.
<br/>
Programming in Education
Recognizing the importance of programming, educational institutions are incorporating coding into their curricula. By introducing programming at an early age, students are exposed to computational thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.
<br/>
Integrating coding into school curricula equips students with essential skills for the future. It encourages critical thinking, logical reasoning, and the ability to break down complex problems into smaller manageable tasks. By engaging in programming exercises and projects, students develop resilience, perseverance, and creativity.<br/> Programming education goes beyond coding itself; it fosters computational thinking, which is a valuable mindset applicable in various domains.
<br/>
Programming for Empowerment
One of the most empowering aspects of programming is the ability to create solutions. By understanding programming languages, individuals can bring their ideas to life, develop software applications, and design innovative solutions to real-world problems.<br/> Programming empowers individuals to become creators rather than just consumers of technology.<br/> It encourages entrepreneurship, as individuals can develop and launch their own software products or services, contributing to economic growth and societal development.
<br/>
Ethical Considerations in Programming
As programming continues to shape our lives, it is crucial to address ethical considerations. Developers and programmers have a responsibility to ensure that the technologies they create are developed ethically, without biases, and with consideration for the impact on society.<br/> As artificial intelligence and machine learning become more prevalent, it is important to navigate ethical dilemmas surrounding privacy, data security, and the potential for automation to displace jobs.<br/> Programming should be guided by principles of fairness, inclusivity, and social responsibility.
<br/>
Programming as a Universal Language
Programming transcends cultural and linguistic barriers. It serves as a universal language that allows individuals from different backgrounds and nationalities to collaborate on solving problems and building innovative solutions. Through open-source projects and online communities, programmers worldwide can share their knowledge, collaborate on projects, and collectively push the boundaries of technology.<br/> Programming as a universal language promotes global connectivity and collaboration.
<br/>
Conclusion
In conclusion, programming has become an indispensable skill in the digital age and will only grow in importance for the future. It empowers individuals to communicate with computers, automate tasks, and solve complex problems. Programming skills open doors to a wide range of career opportunities and enable individuals to shape the technologies that will shape our lives. <br/>Understanding code and computational thinking are vital for navigating the increasingly digital world.<br/> By embracing programming, we can unlock innovation, foster creativity, and build a future that is driven by technology.
